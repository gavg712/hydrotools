\title{Hydrograph plus Hyetograph}
\usage{
hydrograph(
  data,
  time = time,
  runoff = Runoff,
  rain = Rain,
  agg.time_unit = "3 hours",
  agg.window = 8,
  vsep = 0.5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{tbl or Data frame object.}

\item{time}{Vector name of timestamp variable in `data`.}

\item{runoff}{Vector name of Runoff variable in `data`.}

\item{rain}{Vector name of Rainfall variable in `data`.}

\item{agg.time_unit}{Integrer. Default "3 hours". Time lag unit to aggregate
rainfall bars by sum function. This will be showed as light blue line of
hyetrograph.}

\item{agg.window}{Integrer. Default 8. Value of number o values from rainfall
data to aggregate by rolling mean function. This will be showed as dark
blue line of hyetrograph.}

\item{vsep}{numeric. Default 0.5. Value between 0 and 1 to scale the vertical
separation of hyetograph from hydrograph. 1 means 100% of difference
between min and max runoff.}
}
\description{
The function to plot a hyetograph over a hydrograph based on ggplot functions.
